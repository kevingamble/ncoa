                <h3>How it Works - Understanding the Program</h3>
                <p>Canada Post licenses the NCOA Mover Data to approved Service Bureaus who in turn offer you software and/or professional services. Mover Data Services form a privacy compliant database that contains millions of mover records.</p>

                <p>You can apply updates to your data in one of two ways (see <a href="#">Terms of Use</a> for full details):</p>
                
                <ul>
                	<li>If you hold an existing relationship with a customer, you can update your customer records with the new address information.</li>              
                	<li>If you are preparing a mailing, you can perform a one-time update of your mailing list with the new address information.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The NCOA Mover Data service cannot be used to reach movers with marketing and acquisition campaigns. Learn more about our <a href="#">Mover Media</a> offerings should you wish to promote your business to movers.</p>

                    <p>Canada Post licenses the NCOA Mover Data to Service Bureaus who have developed matching software based on defined Canada Post requirements. This software identifies movers in your customer databases or mailing lists, using a combination of names and addresses. To identify a match, the software must recognize your customer’s first and last name against the NCOA database’s first and last name and old address on file.</p>
    
                    <p>You can cleanse customer records via software-as-a-service or professional services, depending on your NCOA provider’s offering.</p>

                    <p>A Business Relationship exists between a mover and an organization when an individual or business has:

                    <p>If such purchase, donation, rent, lease or contract for the provisions of products and services involves ongoing use or transactions under a subscription, account, loan or similar relationship, the 24-month period starts on the day the relationship terminates.</p>

                <div>
                	<p>Prior to processing NCOA data, all receiving parties must agree to NCOA Terms of Use, which ensure that each party handling the data understands how NCOA Mover Data can, and cannot, be used. Once you agree to the Terms of Use, you will receive a Terms of Use ID.  Provide this ID to your NCOA Provider, and upon validation of your ID, they can begin processing your data. Under no circumstance can data be processed prior to submitting a valid ID. For this reason, be sure to agree to Terms of Use well beyond a scheduled data job. The Terms of Use must be renewed annually to keep your ID active.</p>
                    
                    <p>Important note: Company and contact information collected as part of this process will remain strictly anonymous. Canada Post will never disclose company or contact information.</p>
