                <h3>How it Works - Understanding the Program</h3>
                <p>Canada Post licenses the NCOA Mover Data Service database to approved Service Bureaus who in turn offer your business software and/or professional services.  Mover Data Services form a privacy compliant database that contains millions of mover records.</p>

                <p>You can apply updates to your data in one of two ways (see <a href="#">Terms of Use</a> for full details):</p>
                
                <ul>
                	<li>If you hold an existing relationship with customers, you can update the customer's records with the new address information.</li>              
                	<li>If you are preparing a mailing, you can update your mailing list with the new address information.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The NCOA Mover Data Service cannot be used to reach movers with marketing and acquisition campaigns.  Learn more about our <a href="#">Mover Media</a> offerings should you wish to promote your business to movers.</p>
